> Yet another man.

Hi, I am Cai Zongdao. I previously worked as Project Manager at a commonweal foundation ([MaHong Foundation](https://www.szmhf.org/)), focused on the study on government information disclosure. I am now self-employed as an engineer.

I studied Educational Technology and graduated from [Beijing Normal University Zhuhai Campus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Normal_University) by 2014.

I love Python, Cognitive Psychology, Maths and Computer Science. They open up a bigger picture of different scale to me and I am eager for pursuing the grounding in reality, and to encounter more unkowns that need to be uncovered.
